It's been a long time since planettimmy.com was active. I've hosted a couple of things at aidley.com,
but I figured it was time to make an actual web presence. Today I am trying out [Hugo](https://gohugo.org/)
for creating my webpage, which is a system for very quickly creating static webpages
from markdown. The page itself is hosted on github. The theme is called [Anatole](https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole),
and is the first reasonable-looking theme I tried that actually rendered without errors.
