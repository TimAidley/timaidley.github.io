## ENGINEER / MANAGER  GAMES &#x2022; XR &#x2022; VFX

I have spent the last **28 years working in games, VFX, and XR**. One of the best things about work is all the interesting people you get to work with from all kinds of disciplines and walks of life. I enjoy being part of a team - collaboration, talking through and surmounting challenges is one life's great joys.

# EXPERTISE
I have worked on 18 published games on PC, Console, iPhone, Android, and Quest.

I have worked on teams varying in size from **3 to 60 people**, in individual contributor, lead engineer, and engineering management positions.

I have been **using Unity since 2011**, and **worked _at_ Unity since 2021**. I have also used several proprietary C++ engines, and worked on **a cloud-rendered Unreal project while at Google**.

I have written games in **C#, C++**, C, Lua, Python, Actionscript and Javascript.

Some of my favorite career moments include:

* The reaction of Unity leadership to the new terrain tech my team made.
* Porting **Tilt Brush** to the **Oculus Quest** at Google.
* Hitting 1 million downloads in a week with _MMX Racing_ at Hutch.
* **Leading a small team** to complete **two games** for the Xbox 360 in just **seven months** at Relentless Software.
* Writing the hippogriff motion control animation bridge for **_Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_**.
* Being the **sole engineer** on _Hunt for the Red Baron_ and releasing it in **nine months**.

During my time in games, I have worked on a wide variety of game systems, including Enemy AI, Visual effects, Menu systems, Game audio, Networking, Vehicle dynamics, Character control, Terrain rendering, Analytics, Debugging tools, and Prototyping systems.
